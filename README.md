# M3U URL 4 HOME
I created this project to run on my home raspberry to avoid to change every time in all TVs URL from m3u list.
I only need to change in raspberry file ".env" and it's run on all televisions.

## How to use
Create a ".env" file in root folder and set like this:
URL="http://m3uurl.com/"
PORT=3000

Then, run:
npm start

(If it's not run use this first: npm install)
